      <description>What is not real? What is real? How much of the surface of this myopian crackle is configurable? What can I believe on? What makes up faith? How trustworthy is the internet? Does things actually exist outside the screen? Do words have any meaning? Is there consensus for meaning? What makes up man? What makes up for memories? Do records need to exist? Does pain need to be hidden?
Is it future?</description>

Fucking evenings are &amp;hellip; you get the point. Stop making everything look so damn ugly with white light. Everything looks better in a yellow tint. The grand spread of using white light is probably a fucking kabal conspiracy at this point to turn the world into a concrete ridden satan sphere.</description>
