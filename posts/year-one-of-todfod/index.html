        <p>In a couple of weeks todfod will be an year old. It has been a simple,
quarantined year so far. I have told you some about my life updates.</p>
<p>At first todfod was thought of as a vessel for updating on life and other
pursuits. It has done so wonderfully albeit things have been a bit vague. The
theme has been switched up to add categories, SSL isn&rsquo;t supported and there are
images. WOW.</p>
<p>But todfod was secretly intended to be a scholastic pursuit where I would post
things and writings a little above instagram styled update posts. I have failed
in that regard for the simple reason that I don&rsquo;t know much. I am learning but
for all the beads I find, I can&rsquo;t string them together to mold anything of value
that you might not have thought about.</p>
<p>Todfod hasn&rsquo;t met this secret standard. It will be changed. I know teenagers
writing about smoking, love and edgy posts aren&rsquo;t that interesting to many if
not all. I am also pretty sure no more than five people put this address in
their address bar often. But I truly don&rsquo;t care much about the audience as much
as I care about the craft.</p>
<p>Todfod isn&rsquo;t going to end. Not anytime soon. But hopefully the posts will be
somewhat interesting. The metric for interesting is what I find interesting.
Right now it is all a gaff.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and welcome to the second year.</p>
