<p>The moments have passed at a play. I only have the wisdom age can bring. There
are times when I remember those old days of plum, innocent youth and wonder
where it has all gone. It has changed so much these past few years. Some things
I don&rsquo;t even recognize. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t recognize myself.</p>
<p>Some nights long while ago, when my grandmother was still alive I thought of
things. I thought of death. Of old age. Of being rich and famous. Of being
smart and handsome. I seem to be living through that age. Without any of those
adjectives. Can&rsquo;t help but feel like a reject sometimes.</p>
<p>But in the overall, I can&rsquo;t complain much. It is just the standards you set and
talk about never seem to meet actual progress. Maybe it is the grandeur of
fiction. Maybe it is that I will go nowhere. These thoughts haunt me from time
to time. They are the darkest of all thoughts.</p>
<p>Something has ruined me. What it is I cannot tell. I live in a hyper real world.
The hyper reality surrounds me from head to toe. I think like a didact, but go
through it like a slave. I think that I think but all of intelligence seems to
come from nowhere, leading to nothing. Might as well be a closet nhilist at
this point.</p>
<p>But the old days huh. The optimism. The color. The candor. To think what I
could be now if I started then and all those things. All of those that take you
nowhere.</p>
<p>Who else has had thoughts like these? Who else wants an out? I seem to be
digging a tunnel to rid myself of this prison. This is merely a front.</p>
<p>There are some very spiritually disgusting things that I have done. Things I am
ashamed of. Things I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be caught doing. Some know my secrets. Most never will. I
hope it stays that way forever.</p>
<p>There are mistakes you make as a child. If you make a mistake now the penance
seems to be more than ten fold. But I will keep making a lot of mistakes. You
will too. Human, all to Human.</p>
<p>Wandering through life as a Eighteen, nineteen year old. There are a few things
I would like to share to all of us lost souls out there. These I have learnt
not to do. I don&rsquo;t prescribe what to do. Only what not to do.</p>
<h4 id="advice">Advice:</h4>
<p>Do not keep ink records of yourself on the internet. The internet is written in
ink. It will never go away. You will do stupid things every once in a while. Do
not put it on the internet. There should be no record of you growing up, except
what you keep yourself. <em>(I am talking with a very philosophical angle here. The technical side might come in another post.)</em> Do
not keep a record by doing anything stupid. Get a website and start a blog. Your&rsquo;s truly is an example.</p>
<p>Do not think too much about the opposite sex. Do not watch porn. Porn will
construct such a reality in your brain that you will be fucked for life. Do not
go there.</p>
<p>Once you say something. You can never unsay it.</p>
<p>Do not construct an identity around smoking, drinking or philandering.</p>
<p>Do not be a nerd.</p>
<p>Do not say that you are going to do something before doing it.</p>
<p>Do not care much about money if you are rich or have generational wealth.</p>
<p>Do not care about politics and political issues. You are a child. Your opinions don&rsquo;t matter. Shut up.</p>
<p>Do not take history for granted.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/Industrial%20Society%20and%20Its%20Future.pdf">And read Uncle Ted.</a></p>
<p>You will be molded by technology rather than the other way around. Stop the junk.</p>
<p>I claim to be nobody. But these things I know and will vouch for till the end.  I have learned some of these things the hard way.</p>
<p><strong>The world you were born in doesn&rsquo;t exist.</strong></p>
