        <p>A tanking business. A ruined economy. Idiots and stupid IYI&rsquo;s everywhere. A 50 km railway line. An unelected idiot
in a elected place of business. A fragile heart. Virtue-signalling. Bigoteering. A college that will probably suck.
A leaking roof for no reason. No money. Lots of money but nothing to do. Heat. Rain. Heat. Rain. A lockdown.
A pandemic. Huge international organizations without much in terms of credibility  or actual expertise. Bad statistics.
Anti-Maskers. Shitty movies. Even shittier TV. A family name to carry on. Time to finally take on responsibility.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
