        <p>There is a huge conspiracy brewing at hand. It  has to do with printing materials. What are these materials? Licenses and passports. The license one is what concerns me the most so I will dwell on that more. I got my license around 15 months ago. Not the license per say but the piece of paper that acts as a license. A green piece of paper and a pink piece. I paid around two to three thousand rupees for the entire license registration process with expenses. It is a lot of money. While getting the piece of paper I was told by the cocksuckers at
the yatayat office that I would get my license by the next 6 months. Not too impressive but I had read that they just imported a few new printers to print the cards. I was content.
But then time passed and I have no license. So what is the conspiracy? How about a conspiracy that involves the Director of Transport, the officials at the department and a few actors
who are in politics? Could there be made a case that the director of transport is in direct cohoots to rip off everyone imported printing machines at an exceedingly high cost?
A printer worth millions would make sure the actors pocket a ton of money in <em>excess expenses</em>. How about another angle to this conspiracy? A team of guys and gals went to the beautiful
country of France to train themselves on the operation of this beautiful new machine that will print my beautiful face in a license card. But instead of actually getting the training
they pocketed the daily expenses and went to Versailles for a walk. They returned back with no training but with pictures of Louis&rsquo;s Bathtub to show their families. Would this be possible? Obviously not.</p>
<p>What about another outlandish conspiracy? To check whether your license has been printed or not,
you need to send an sms to a number with your license regsitration number for a certain charge. Now if I was in this business of gaining money from SMSes I would make sure that you
have to send as many SMSes as possible so that I can pocket a ton of cash by doing nothing but delaying the printing of cards. Could such an insulting tactic have been used by our
fellow people? Don&rsquo;t listen to me. I am a conspiracy-theorist. Listen to them. They will tell you everything. Read The Kathmandu Post and Kantipur to know about this. Not from me.
Those institutions have journalists working for them and they have the crendentials. They are <strong>Official</strong>.</p>
<p>What about the passports now? There is a shortage of passports. Now all you DV candidates&rsquo; wails will get even louder. The American dream just got more expensive. How? Now since we know
there are only a handful of passports to distribute the actors in the Passport Department will jack up the prices so high for a fucking passport that going to the US on a boat will probably be cheaper.
But being the obedient and kindly people we are we will happily pay for all of this with a smile. Because Governmental Institutions are wonderful and the administrations in departments can do nothing wrong. I am willing to bet that if the government gave the job of printing and distributing these <em>identity badges</em> to Mr. Chaudhary, he would probably turn this into a 4 step/20 minute process and pump these bitches out like <em><strong>wai-wai</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This lockdown is making me go absolutely insane. But keep on listening to the officials. They are telling the truth and please believe in a bigger government. Believe in protests. In activists. It will surely bring a change.  Also soon, next in line for a wait time of upto 15 months is your insulin. Too sad that it&rsquo;ll be too long before you get it. Maybe stockpile it for your grandkids and tell them to not show it to anyone. Your government will surely save you. Your votes will obviously matter.</p>
