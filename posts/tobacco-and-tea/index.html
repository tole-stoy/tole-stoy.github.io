<p>As I write these words there is a faint nicotine buzz in my head.
Tobbacco can be fun but to be addicted to it would be
quite a distaste for the body. But in moderation everything is alright. In
moderation.</p>
<p>As I write this post I am in a vast expanse of tea plants and trees. The air is fresh. It smells of
tea. There is a big  beautiful tree across this small gentle stream and it is quite amazing.</p>
<p>Man is always best fit and optimal in nature. And to think that this place is
only a few kilometeres jog from my home is quite amazing.
The birds holler around me and there is no human nearby. Just as I like it sometimes.</p>
<p>The situation with the virus has escalated to new heights and everything is
closed down again. The government has
failed and so have the people. Some people I knew fell like flies from this
and there is no end in sight. What will become of us? What will save us?</p>
<p>Human might and genius are probably the best bets. But until then&hellip;.. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>As the vast and complicated systems of nations, economy and technology have
shown themselves to be quite fragile I wonder if any work might be done by our
overlords to change course of these subjects. Knowing their competence, this
seems foolhardy a thought.</p>
<p>But enough about systems and governments. This was initially about the feels of
being with nature and the tea leaves. And nature is the medicine I prescribe to the people feeling
lost or betrayed by all things. Remember if it ends, you are at its mercy.</p>
