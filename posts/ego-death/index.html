        <p>The self exists and with it so does the ego.</p>
<h3 id="sometime-during-2076">Sometime during 2076</h3>
<p>We were five of us. Teenage boys in the forest of Godavari. With quite a sizeable
amount of psilocybin and no one to bother us. The initialization
proccess was mild with weird twists in vision that slowly morphed to an entire
twisting and turning of the physical form around us. All of us communicated
that it was what we saw.</p>
<p>But somewhere among all the wonders of twisting colors, shapes and patterns. A
deep reverie of enormous proportions was forming. The self began to fell like a
complete nothing. In the vast expanse of the entirety of all beings,
substances, time and space; I was amounted to nothing. I was
but a child in this vast prarie of matter and form. No amount of pride, vanity
or all of those self-congratulating feelings would prove that it was otherwise.</p>
<p>It was almost how a religion prescribes an edict that cannot be broken and in
the hearts of some they cannot even conceive of defying it.</p>
<p>It was all pure and honest. I was
swimming in the waters of the worldly spirit and after all this reflection that
happened in an almost ephemeral yet paradoxically exceedingly lengthy amount of time I felt a
rejuvination that I haven&rsquo;t felt since. I felt one with the trees and plants.
Felt one with the soil underneath my feet. The air was speaking to me and the
sky&hellip;.Well, the sky looked extraordinarily-stupefyingly beautiful.</p>
<p>I killed myself, then was born again. An ego death.</p>
<p>I talk of this experience now because I have been ruminating about this ordeal
quite a lot these past days. Among my fondest memories in the valley - this is one.</p>
