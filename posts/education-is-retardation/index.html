        <p>Controversial? Yes. Reality? True.</p>
<p>If any of you reading this still have any faith in any formal system of education -
you are a moron.</p>
<p>If that was enough to trigger you. You can fuck off. Thin skinned people shouldn&rsquo;t be
reading a wise man&rsquo;s educated opinion.</p>
<p>Your acceptance  the system of education stems from either one of two places. Either
you did remarkably well in it and thus see that can be good for others as well,
or you failed in it and blame your failure on the system
for not adequately meeting your &lsquo;needs&rsquo; which is pretty pathetic when I think about it. Some people don&rsquo;t fall into any of these categories. These people have already succeded.</p>
<p>A system designed by a
top down bureaucracy shouldn&rsquo;t/will not meet your individual needs. It is there to fulfil a
systematic average duty. To meet a certain criteria of average statistics so the Executive
branch can pat themselves on their backs for &ldquo;educating the children&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Happy with my very smart assesment of what the system means to and for you? Good. Now let&rsquo;s look at
it like the rational children we are. The education system as I told you is there to fill a
average national creed. It&rsquo;s bigger exterior goal is to show the International World that we are following
the same rules, the same curriculum that they are so they can feel good about their imperialism on
all fronts. So that our leaders can enjoy being called civilized infront of others.</p>
<p>But this is more of a conspiratory reason for the system to exist in the first place. This creates an endless series of puppet steering that we should try to steer clear of.
Sure the current system has its highlights but it is absolutely riddled
by retarded policies and institutions run by actual retards. Right now just
realize that the system exists for the system, not the <strong>individual</strong> you.</p>
<p>At a glance and speaking from personal horrific experiences the education system is an egregious waste of time, money and resources.
There are subjects being taught in our schools that make absolutely no-sense, some subjects are essentially propaganda pieces for the ruling party,
Other subjects can be traced back to NGO&rsquo;s and most are plain boring and stupid.</p>
<p>During schooling for example we took a population/education class for four years. The maxim of the subject was stretched so much for so long that
while you were out you didn&rsquo;t care nor remembered about &lsquo;Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs&rsquo;, the whole subject became a meme-fest on &lsquo;How to wear a condom&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Contraceptives&rsquo; and sex organs that we used to giggle at. Don&rsquo;t even ask about the stupid one page answers that we had to meticulously craft so a stupid idiot teacher
could award us with a point.</p>
<p>Or take Social studies which is just a propaganda platform for the maoists. No actual chapter about the war, the things that went down. Just happy stories of national
unity and diversity and some other horse shit about things that have no ground in reality.</p>
<p>These are just minute details in the whole &lsquo;Education Industrial Complex&rsquo; that I remember from schooling. One could probably argue and dig up roles
of international agencies, NGO&rsquo;s, lobby-groups and political parties in the shaping of such stupid curriculums.</p>
<p>Also something to think about: The average Government worker works less hours than an average middle schooler.</p>
<p>The question about the education system isn&rsquo;t just about the details it is also about the bigger than life message it sends. Psychologically the system is mostly about signalling.
In this age where almost everyone needs to have a degree or a form of diploma to stand out in the job market education is the greatest and most widely
accepted form of signalling there is. It signals that you work, and that you can but not necessarily what you know. Caplan&rsquo;s book might explain it a little better.</p>
<p>Another psychological ripple effect from the habit of going to school from 8-5 is that it domesticates you. Your life during school entirely hinges about and for school
in most cases. It is a colossal disaster when it comes to any form of networking or trying out any apprenticeship. Remember those two words: apprenticeship and networking.</p>
<p>The most you are going to learn from your teachers is how to be a teacher. The most discipline you are going to learn in school is  going to be timed by a rattling metal
sound every hour or so.</p>
<p>So if you are wasting tremendous amounts of money and time in school for the attainment of &ldquo;education&rdquo; you are not just failing in the endeavour but also causing mass financial ruin
on your family.</p>
<h3 id="the-prescription-for-education">The prescription for education</h3>
<p>An entire thesis could be summed up on the financialization of education, the yield of every dollar spent on education has and the overall national development that education can cause.
The last point is what everyone uses to push their insane prices, the insane budgetary proposals and the overall highlights of the entire system.</p>
<p>I am not going to write about budgetary proposals or how to better structure the curriculum because I am neither qualified to write about such a measure and also I would
propose a massive cut in education funding from the federal government. And we all know how that sits with most people.</p>
<p>What I am trying to convey with this simple prescription for education is to speak directly to its customers i.e the students and have a real heart to heart conversation about
what he/she should be trying to do with his/her time and energy. Whether school should really be the primary focus and whether this is the education that he/she truly wants.</p>
<p>Let me start by asking a couple of questions:</p>
