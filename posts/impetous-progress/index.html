        <p>There was a Nassim Taleb quote somewhere that said if one was not sure how tradition has continued for a long time
chances were it continued because it was right and one should just leave it be. This nugget has been in the back of my mind ever since
I heard it and saw things that were formed long ago that didn&rsquo;t make sense to me just then but do so now. Revelations occur when one reads
attentively what one hasn&rsquo;t understood and observes that under his own supervision. Something immediate to me showed itself in such a light -
when I started looking at the accounts of the business.</p>
<p>I never paid attention in my accountancy class and thus always struggled. Thank god that I paid enough attention to learn what debit and credit
actually mean and function but apart from that I scantly remember anything manual. When looking at the accounts of the business I was under the impression
that an immediate switch to an electronic system would save the business from collapsing under itself but now with Nassim&rsquo;s valuable wisdom in mind it seems obvious
that the books aren&rsquo;t to be blamed as much as the bookkeepers themselves. Being the mediocre incapabalites they are. Infact, simple accounting is actually somewhat relaxing
and it has dawned on me that the more complex the account is the more leaks one might encounter. I will leave the Balance sheet auditing to the auditors.</p>
<p>It has been going good. I should write here more often but I haven&rsquo;t disciplined myself to such a task. I have been reading a lot and it has been occupying my time
and so has trade. I bought a kindle e-reader from the funds I procured by selling my smartphone and it has been a good investment. If one finds fault and dissatisfaction from
having to communicate through a keypad dialer and e-mail chances are you won&rsquo;t make it much in terms of a healthy cordial revelation of <em>thyself</em>. Please for the love of your mother
disconnect from the web and devoid yourself of upcummies and sit and think alone. Don&rsquo;t make programmed excuses. If you can&rsquo;t take this simple advice; <strong>Thou can go fuck thyself.</strong></p>
