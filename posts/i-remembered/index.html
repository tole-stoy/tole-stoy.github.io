        <p>One day while playing around in one of my previous schools before St. Xaviers, I hit my head in one of the lower edges of a slide and had to get a few stiches.
I just happened to remember that moment today. These remembrances of things past haven&rsquo;t been a rare occuring these past few months.
. It is as if the place I came back to had a few tapes to show me of me and now that I remember these moments, the heart fills up with a shuddering uneasiness and a hint of vague nostalgia.</p>
<p>I have always been pretty quite. Not amongst my close friends but in general. I am quite fond of my quiteness. People
who talk too much generally have lots to talk but nothing much to say. But sometimes I think I may have been a little too quite. I have always seen that it is the quite ones you should watch out for but sometimes it can make you suffer. Really suffer.</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories of life is of me passing a small irrigation canal on the way from my mother&rsquo;s parents house to my house. I remember the splash of water when I put my feet in it and I remember
tirelessly crossing it to get home as soon as possible. I remember that I was with other children, possibly friends of mine but then I really cannot tell. A distant memory
from early childhood is a pretty faded one. Sometimes I even question it regarding its legitimacy. Was it a  dream or a memory?</p>
<p>I remember the first day I went to highschool. I remember that one vivdly. I remember the excess of that place. A man suited to my humble tastes and expenses finds himself pretty out
of place in a place of such excess, such &lsquo;architecture&rsquo;, such self proclaimed superiority. It is now quite disappointing to realize that I let the same excess dictate my tastes. I especially remember the people who worked there. I remember those guys vividly.
I hate that place.</p>
<p>My Grandmother&rsquo;s amusement while she tells my childhood stories are irritating but fun. I spent a good deal of my infancy with my
grandmother and grandfather and she tries to tell me everything about it. I hardly remember any of it since I was so young and I act like I am not listening to what she has to say but I secretly wish to go back. There is a deep longing to go back but such
dreams only a madman dreams of. That is what everyone has had me believe.</p>
<p>I remember much but this is all that I&rsquo;ll write about for now. Writing about myself is proving to be really difficult.</p>
