        <p>From the time I spent managing a Business that dealt with wholesale I saw what happens when
cashflow sucks. And what happens is that you will slowly but surely go out of business.</p>
<p>If you have a business that relies on heavy credit from the consumer and the downpayment or payment
constitues only a small part of the sales then that means the cashflow is fucked because you have less
cash. Simple. And less cash means problems. Lots of problems. If you have dipped your toes into trade
I am sure you will have realized this.</p>
<p>I am keeping it brief and simple here without examples. Think of metaphysics when
I talk about business. If you see no cashflow - RUN.</p>
