        <p>In this land of all forsaken souls one finds himself trapped by the making of his own fate, the cultivation of his own values.
Even after resolutely defining parameters and a stringent moral self-structure there is nothing more devastating to be destroyed completely not by
better ideals to improve upon but a rotten core that hardly has ever achieved anything or created anything. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Look around you.
The asthetics you see, the corrupt nature of the soul that has shattered the pure beauty of all individual soul. A repugnant smell
that has led us all to believe that we are below them and under them . We have yet to realize our human potential to
show them what we can build, not as a race but as a cultural force that shapes itself in beauty and order, wiping off filth and disorder.
No serious society has to have a backbone so flimsy, so irrigid that it makes one&rsquo;s soul tumble at the mere mention of it.
This was never a nation of strong men or strong ideals, history is us and it has said.  I feel it is time.</p>
<p>The sooner we realize that the faults  lie on measured men who use us not in any noble fashion or honesty, the quicker this
can go away. This consternation at everyday rudimentary events and prized intellects has taken us no-where and will take us no-where.
The roots of our nation have never been established and until so happens we will suffer. Our vices of congratulatory kindness and vanity has
ensured evil takes hold of us and that forgiveness becomes the platitude to sign us off as nobles. Say that no more,  because in time someone
will be born that will set this right and through them they will show the evil-doers what mercy actually entails. Sword and blood. This enraged tiger within
us has to open itself to our adversaries and show them what a real stand looks like. What a real nation of people looks like.</p>
