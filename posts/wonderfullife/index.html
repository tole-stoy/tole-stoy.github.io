        <p>What is not real? What is real? How much of the surface of this myopian crackle
is configurable? What can I believe on? What makes up faith? How trustworthy is
the internet? Does things actually exist outside the screen? Do words have any
meaning? Is there consensus for meaning? What makes up man? What makes up for
memories? Do records need to exist? Does pain need to be hidden?</p>
<p>Is it future? Or is it past? Is it funny? Is the movie good? Is the movie bad?
How much money did you make? Did it feel good? What are you going to do with
it? Don&rsquo;t like what I&rsquo;m writing? It&rsquo;s my blog? Oh that picture is funny? Look
how funny that picture is. Real funny. It has a caption in it. Who made it? Guy
must be a genius huh? He killed himself? Oh no. What about his familly? I dont
care about them do I?</p>
<p>Oh did you hear the news? They killed that boy. Threw his body in a swamp. Do
you know what the police did? Nothing. Haha. Lets meme this one. What does the
police do? Nothing? You are right. Wonder what happened to his sister? Didn&rsquo;t
you hear? She got lost in the forest. The parents are officially childless now.
Oh my god, what a meme.</p>
<p>He went to the war? He came back with medals you know. They cast those fucking
medals in china. Oh my god, how funny is that. The funnier part is he fought
china in the trenches. And now his army outsourced the medals to China? Oh my
god. Do you believe that?</p>
<p>Have you watched Seinfeld? Its a show you know. It&rsquo;s a show about nothing. Do
you realize how comedic that is? To be about nothing? I bet you haven&rsquo;t seen
seinfeld. I mean who has, right?</p>
<p>Did you hear what happened to Bishal? He is apparently in a coma? Means the guy
cannot hear nor talk. How meme is that, to not be able to walk and talk. Do you
know why he is in a coma? Apparently he got in a gangfight? And some guy hit
him in the head with an axe. His brain splattered all over the ground. They had
to pick up the pieces and put it back. Too sad that didn&rsquo;t work. He is in a
coma now.</p>
<p>Do you know that a lizard is the president? Yeah. A shape shifting lizard rules
the country. How funny is that? I mean you know humans can&rsquo;t rule but a fucking
lizard? Had to pullout the F word for comedic effect. What do you think the
lizard eats? I mean he must surely eat humans right? If he doesn&rsquo;t does Shandar
Momo do the trick?</p>
<p>You know I killed my wife right? Oh you didn&rsquo;t? That bitch was nagging me a
little too much. Take care of your shit and where were you? Again and Again.
Same tone. Why the fuck does she care what I do with my time. It&rsquo;s not her
time, nor her fucking money. Anyways bought a nice shiny axe from the
blacksmith. Spent thirty minutes sharpening it. You heard the story of the
guy who spent thirty minutes sharpening his axe unlike the other guy who
started hacking at it, right? I cut her first. Hacked her straight to the neck and
blood splattered all over the fucking floor. Too good that I had my newspapers
on the floor. Sucked the blood right fucking away. Clean job. Used the kitchen
knife to hack her limbs, her hands, Didn&rsquo;t even leave the fingers in their
places. Cut them all up. Wrapped them in foil and put them in plastic. Then Got
up early in the morning which I hadn&rsquo;t done in years. Washed all of her remains
down the drain. Why is the police shouting outside? But wait man, why did you
wrap it up in aluminium foil?</p>
<p>For comedic effect. I will surely become a meme?</p>
<p>You know the brother is in London now? He is a doctor. Takes care of patients.
He takes good care of them. Old hags who should be dead any minute they enter
his doors wake up and start running a marathon after he cares for them. Oh they
love him. The old hags. They use their retirement money to pay him. Oh yes, he
is very rich now. Very rich. He owns an electric car.</p>
<p>Do you know what I tell my students every single day? That they should study
hard and fast for their Population studies. I mean if they don&rsquo;t they will
obviously suffer. I teach them about malthus you know, About the triangle of
needs. Surely I am a good teacher. Look what Sugam scored. He is surely going
places. Look at Abhishek, he will be bolting screws in gas pipelines in dubai.
Only twenty four out of fifty seven. I have no hope for him. I heard he writes
diatribes on the internet, surely a mark of something. Mark of the beast? Also,
did you hear what happened to Miss Sushma? Bitch apparently got mugged while
going home. What was Batman doing? Taking a vacation. Save us you bat fuck.</p>
<p>You know I reading harry plotter. Some story. Witches, dragons, goblins and
mermaids. How real can it get. Do you know it copies of the Mahabharata? Oh it
does. I have read it. And watched it. And read it. And watched it. Read it.
Watched it. Read it. Watched it&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Did you hear what WHO is up to nowadays? They say AIDS wasn&rsquo;t deadly at all.
They are saying it increases lifespans by upto fifty percent. They even
FDDMMSSAA certified a yogurt that has AIDS in it. It tastes good you know. Come
here let me buy one for you. It has AIDS. Life-expectancy increasing stuff. We
will never grow old jimmy. We will never go old. If we keep gulping these
yogurts everyday. We will never die jimmy. We will never die.</p>
<p>Why do you write man? Oh why do I write? For my children ofcourse. I want them
to see things as I saw it. But you killed your wife? How are you going to have
children. Oh Bertrand. Wives come and go. Infact I have found another dame who
wants me to marry her. So, thats settled. And wives are a life long process. I
mean as long as&hellip;..</p>
<p>I was in a country called Jhapa once where a tough mighty dark race of peoples'
lived above the surface but below was totally something else which I never
cared to look for because my dealings in that area were with the above people
who feasted on deers everyday and there must have been atleast twenty thousand
families and they all had deers everyday which is amazing to think I mean where
do these deers come from I asked and they just nooded their heads in agreement
as If I was asking for their permission and not a question well anyways
I went on a deer hunt myself shot a nice buck myself only to find after
the fall of the being and going near it very gently smoothly very
hunterlike to find it was a child wearing a deer hide and a quick
glance around I saw with my eyes cleared that all these deers around
were children on deer hides and they all had been children all along
and My God I nearly tripped when I recalled yesterday night feasting on
the meat to now find a dead child in my hand. Quite a hunt.</p>
<p>The slight drizzle is now phasing out into sun beams that are kissing the land.
The green is now slowly drying and the air is slowly heating to the brightening
of the day. The birds chirp calmly and the storm has passed. People have been
holed in their homes for two days and life for some is an equal struggle like
that of yesterday. The raindrops hammer the tin in a awkward balance of rhythm
and sight. Long streches of land are now swamps and will remain so for the next
few months. The perfect brooding ground for tadpoles and small fishes who will
live, die, hibernate under the earth waiting for the rain till next year.</p>
<p>All lost bodies and souls will never be remembered hitherto again. They are
more than forgotten. The souls that killed them are long forgotten too. The
land is red hot and steaming to the prying eye who looks and thinks of who has
passed it. All humans are equal slaves to life. And will remain so no matter the meme.</p>
<p>It is dark all around now. I am finally out. My hands and legs are
chained. And there are stony walls curving and turning. I am in a hollow
somewhere. A faint light from my back strikes the wall ahead of me with my
shadow casted as the largest member on it. The shadow moves as I move So I
conclude it mine. I can&rsquo;t turn back to see what the light is. I think
about where I last was. Tensing up, getting nervous I try to gather from the
vaults of my memories - where? I was here. Doing the same thing. My
shadow cast over the walls. No sound that I didn&rsquo;t make. My hands and legs
tied. And nothing else forever after. The same again and again.</p>
