        <p>Although I can see him still—<br>
The freckled man who goes<br>
To a gray place on a hill<br>
In gray Connemara clothes<br>
At dawn to cast his flies—<br>
It&rsquo;s long since I began<br>
To call up to the eyes<br>
This wise and simple man.<br>
All day I&rsquo;d looked in the face<br>
What I had hoped it would be<br>
To write for my own race<br>
And the reality:<br>
The living men that I hate,<br>
The dead man that I loved,<br>
The craven man in his seat,<br>
The insolent unreproved—<br>
And no knave brought to book<br>
Who has won a drunken cheer—<br>
The witty man and his joke<br>
Aimed at the commonest ear,<br>
The clever man who cries<br>
The catch cries of the clown,<br>
The beating down of the wise<br>
And great Art beaten down.</p>
<p>Maybe a twelve-month since<br>
Suddenly I began,<br>
In scorn of this audience,<br>
Imagining a man,<br>
And his sun-freckled face<br>
And gray Connemara cloth,<br>
Climbing up to a place<br>
Where stone is dark with froth,<br>
And the down turn of his wrist<br>
When the flies drop in the stream—<br>
A man who does not exist,<br>
A man who is but a dream;<br>
And cried, “Before I am old<br>
I shall have written him one<br>
Poem maybe as cold<br>
And passionate as the dawn.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The Fisherman</em> by <em><strong>William Butler Yeats</strong></em></p>
