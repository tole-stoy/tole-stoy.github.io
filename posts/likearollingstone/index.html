        <p><em>By Bob Dylan</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwOfCgkyEj0">Link to the song here</a></p>
<p>Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn&rsquo;t you?<br>
People&rsquo;d call, say, &ldquo;Beware doll, you&rsquo;re bound to fall&rdquo;<br>
You thought they were all kiddin' you<br>
You used to laugh about<br>
Everybody that was hangin' out<br>
Now you don&rsquo;t talk so loud<br>
Now you don&rsquo;t seem so proud<br>
About having to be scrounging for your next meal</p>
<p>How does it feel?<br>
How does it feel<br>
To be without a home<br>
Like a complete unknown<br>
Like a rolling stone?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely<br>
But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
And nobody&rsquo;s ever taught you how to live out on the street<br>
And now you&rsquo;re gonna have to get used to it<br>
You said you&rsquo;d never compromise<br>
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
He&rsquo;s not selling any alibis<br>
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
And say do you want to make a deal?</p>
<p>How does it feel?<br>
How does it feel<br>
To be on your own<br>
With no direction home<br>
A complete unknown<br>
Like a rolling stone?</p>
<p>You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns<br>
When they all did tricks for you<br>
You never understood that it ain&rsquo;t no good<br>
You shouldn&rsquo;t let other people get your kicks for you<br>
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br>
Ain&rsquo;t it hard when you discover that<br>
He really wasn&rsquo;t where it&rsquo;s at<br>
After he took from you everything he could steal</p>
<p>How does it feel?<br>
How does it feel<br>
To be on your own<br>
With no direction home<br>
Like a complete unknown<br>
Like a rolling stone?</p>
<p>Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people<br>
They&rsquo;re all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made<br>
Exchanging all precious gifts<br>
But you&rsquo;d better take your diamond ring, you&rsquo;d better pawn it babe<br>
You used to be so amused<br>
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
Go to him now, he calls you, you can&rsquo;t refuse<br>
When you ain&rsquo;t got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>
You&rsquo;re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal</p>
<p>How does it feel<br>
How does it feel<br>
To be on your own<br>
With no direction home<br>
Like a complete unknown<br>
Like a rolling stone?</p>
