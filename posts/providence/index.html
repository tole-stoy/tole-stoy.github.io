        <p>Once life starts its course of all available alternate timelines and possibilities and goes from one to the other
like leper frogs swimming in the monsoon rains of Asar, nothing can be calculated. Nor anything be put into order as
one wishes. There are too many ways to choose from. Too many avenues to take.  All the while one could be better than
the other. While the one you took could be the worst.</p>
<p>But such things hardly matter to a saint. For he has understood that all he has taken and all he chooses to take are not wishes one
can logically choose or mathematically calculate. But that, such a thing and series of things happen because providence dictates so. And what
providence dictates. Such happens.</p>
<p>This is not an abbreviated theology nor some esoteric doctrine of the third monk. This bores out of where life for twenty years has taken me.
From one place and time to the next place and time things just happen when they want to happen; no cause or reason can ever explain it and there is not much reason to do so.
Your grandmother dies one day, a premature calf is born lifeless, One stroke in the vein collapses the stature of your Grandfather and well
an organism so small that no mortal can ever eye it - can destroy everything.</p>
<p>There is no logic nor a reason for things to happen. But yet they do and our meaning is shaped and molded from events rather than cause. People call it
logos and it is quite fitting. Us moderns cannot compare to the ancients. Ancients don&rsquo;t compare to the moderns.</p>
<p>This is all for today&hellip;.. I might write more soon&hellip;..may&hellip;&hellip;.might&hellip;&hellip;ma&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
