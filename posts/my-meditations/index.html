        <p>Time is the only tool and actual vessel you have for wealth building. Time functions as the line and
various points across that line you find your goals and systems. Systems are always built around or in
time. Knowledge expands with time. Experience nurtures with time. Wasting it is one big folly. Learning
to respect it is one big virtue.</p>
<p>All time until yesterday is lost. What I know now comes from not throughout the twenty years that I
I have been here but from fragments. School was useless, High school was useless and so will college. Only self-application
matters and is actually worthwhile. Everything else is forgettable and will be forgotten. Like so many tears
in the rain.</p>
<p>Debt turns you into a slave. Never be in debt. Never charge interest when you lend. Never ask for money unless
on critical matters. Only with confidants and very very closed ones.</p>
<p>Computers are an amazing invention. Learn it.</p>
<p>More time, money and resources have been poured into turning your phone into a drug-needle than your willpower
will ever fathom and beat. Learn it is business advertisement. If you know why you are on it, it becomes bearable and somewhat useful.
If you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t even carry one.</p>
<p>The boomer generation is probably the most miserable generation in human existence.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t seek love unless you really start loving yourself. All promiscuity is degenerate and foul. Most people aren&rsquo;t
worth it. Make sure you are.</p>
<p>Religion isn&rsquo;t only about god. Atheism isn&rsquo;t just being rational. Fuck all philandering philosophy. Fuck physcial weakness.
This is all for now.</p>
