        <p>I find this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=534uNzGoR1s">Song</a> the most pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>I let it into my home, I let it into my home<br>
Led a long way down, led a long way down<br>
I let it in from the cold, I let it in from the cold<br>
Led a long way down, led a long way down</p>
<p>I let it into my head, I let it into my head<br>
Led a long way down, led a long way down<br>
I let it into my heart, I let it into my heart<br>
Led a long way down, led a long way down</p>
<p>I let it into my bed, I let it into my bed<br>
Led a long way down, led a long way down<br>
I gave it complete control, I gave it complete control<br>
Led a long way down, led a long way down</p>
<p>I let it into my home (Led a long way down)<br>
I let it in from the cold (Led a long way down)<br>
I let it into my head (Led a long way down)<br>
I let it into my heart (Led a long way down)<br>
I let it into my bed (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)<br>
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)</p>
