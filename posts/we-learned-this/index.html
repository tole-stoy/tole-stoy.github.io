        <p>Sometimes I think about what my generation is all about and it feels like we should have all been population scientists. Remember &lsquo;Population education&rsquo;. I can&rsquo;t believe we hammered our  heads about a subject for countless hours when it could have been taught in an NGO seminar.</p>
<p>If you are a parent reading this. Don&rsquo;t send your kid to an expensive school. Make sure he ends up a Vlogger. Good money in the business.</p>
<p>For my generation reading this. I would like to share a poem by Oppenheimer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Wagie Wagie, go back to your cagie</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Think about the beautiful day you had</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>and come back tomorrow to the cage, Wagie&rdquo;</em></p>
