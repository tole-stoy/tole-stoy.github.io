        <p>I have been thinking about democracy and the conclusion is that democracy is essentially bunk. Thank you Moldbug.</p>
<p>I heard Mr. Baburam was preaching about a directly elected president, removing Cholendra from office and all sorts of &ldquo;great ideas&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s been pretty clear that Baburam is an idiot and nothing more than that.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get about all of this is the still incessant praise for the idea of democracy.
You&rsquo;re telling me that after all this historical struggle, things were supposed to change for the better at a much better pace. The likes of Baburam shoved this idea down our throats but now they dont work and we are supposed to have a go at it again? If that doesn&rsquo;t  mean people in power are pissing on you I wish I was as stupid as you are.</p>
<p>Everything is a whitewash. It&rsquo;s time we start really thinking if we want a rule of law as the backbone of our society or pass on it for taking part in &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; every 5 years.</p>
<p>The state should essentially be run as a corporation. Capitalism must be promoted and general bureaucratic retardation in government offices need to be eliminated. In my opinion the only way to do so would be reinstate Mr. Gyanendra as the man in charge of all. I could give a shit about my &ldquo;participation&rdquo; in government.</p>
<p>Democracy has failed. Stop thinking that your idea matters. It&rsquo;s time to get militant about this.</p>
<p>With all this, I pledge allegiance to the <strong><strong>Crown</strong></strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll expand on my new found beliefs in the upcoming posts.</p>
