        <p>Today is Baisakh 1, 2078. It is new years here. It is also an excuse. Here is mine.</p>
<p>This year has already happened. It is already 2079. I have successfully got into the habit of
making incremental gains in strength, speed and endurance. AKA I&rsquo;m jacked. I can do 100kg deadlifts
easily. I am strong.</p>
<p>This affection towards reading that I have developed will continue. I will have read most classics.
I will be richer in words than any other man I know.</p>
<p>I will have started to learn a skill that heavily involves aesthetics at its core while having impeccable
cash flow in the background. This might be the hardest thing to do since it requires so many moving parts.
But it will be done.</p>
<p>I will have learnt what my time should be directed to.</p>
<p>I will have learnt self-control.</p>
<p>I will be a better/more resourceful human. I will keep vices at moderation and will have nulled most.</p>
<p>And one last thing :-</p>
<p>Eat not to dullness, drink not to elevation</p>
