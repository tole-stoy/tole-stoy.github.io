        <p>If any one is reading this blog right now and are constantly checking on new updates and
feel disappointed, I&rsquo;m sorry but I have nothing of value to say on a regular basis. I derive
value on what I find valuable and don&rsquo;t find my words worthy of paper at this moment.
I have been going through life as a test of one&rsquo;s
ability in action and I think I am actually getting good at it with an equal realization of my stupidity and inability. Humility is important in life.</p>
<p>Meditations have showed me that wisdom is an experienced man&rsquo;s faculty. I was thinking of writing about
education and had written about six thousand words but realized after a few hours that it wasn&rsquo;t as
real as I thought it would be. I am going to write about it but in a way a only a wise man would.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. If anyone&rsquo;s reading.</p>
