        <p>I have decided to permanently move back to my home and possibly make my old home my new home for quite some time. I will probably enroll in one of the local colleges for a Economics
degree and then do something on the side. My pursuit of a foreign education is over for now. The whole rigorous motif of going to some foreign place or a shithole like Kathmandu
would be an unwise decision with these places showing pretty <strong>fragile</strong> outlooks. It is now time to settle here and have a go at it in my own backyard. I will probably start a library in
my name here. It&rsquo;s the least I can do. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
