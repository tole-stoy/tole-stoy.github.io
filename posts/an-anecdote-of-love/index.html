        <p>Oh! how the times whisper. The gentle breezes form and swindle. Into bouquets
of wonderous petals. The hours at hand are precious and ever so giving, ever so
taking. Her eyes are of pearls made, her skin - the touch of snow.</p>
<p>I remember being struck without a warning, the ever flooding dam of love burst
wide open without stop. The first stairs took to holding hands, slowly but
surely to sharing bodies. And how powerful was it to the heart I later
realized, my viceful fortitudes curtailed the view. I regret not being
completly one with her touch. But the regret poises no answers today.</p>
<p>And it took to more mundane heights but high in their spirits they were. The
thoughts we had to share, the feelings we had to awake. All coddled up in
little boxes somewhere away.</p>
<p>Part of me wishes back those things but the bigger part wishes to forget its
ways. To decline would be monstrous. But love turns you into one. No
matter what they say.</p>
<p>And one night as it snows and rains and storms of all sizes plunder everything
away. I write in a daring prose to seek to ravage her my way. A release of the
shadow? A release of honesty bottled away? She doesn&rsquo;t like it. I won&rsquo;t ask forgiveness.</p>
<p>But time has yet passed more and her memory without externalities fades to a
corner. I can only hope that she will remember me, She can only hope I will
remember her.</p>
