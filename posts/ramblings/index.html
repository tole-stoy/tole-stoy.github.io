        <p>&ldquo;Intellectual ideas are hard by to come these days&rdquo; is such a zoomer-centric take. At least in my sphere of aquaintainces, something similiar of an idea seems to be a prevailing one. It also happens that the group of aquaintainces I am talking about think of themselves as &lsquo;the shit&rsquo; as the expression goes. Almost everyone shit talks and trashes others which is quite funny. The jokes that come of these conversations are pretty great and never fail to amuse me. I always take a real intergral part in them. If by this point in this blog you don&rsquo;t find my use of english engaging - I am talking about how I and my friends shit talk about others(maybe you) that may necessarily not be in the group. Relax. I know you do it too.</p>
<p>What is this idea buzzing around in people&rsquo;s domes that you shouldn&rsquo;t be judgemental about others? Give me a break. Judge all you can. Literally all you can. That&rsquo;s the only way you&rsquo;ll honestly gauge yourself with others. Maybe dont go too far and judge so far that it results in some serious confrontation and you get your dome cracked. Otherwise, Judgement is fine and dandy. Keep it to yourself in most cases and &lsquo;use it as a weapon&rsquo; as they say it. You won&rsquo;t go far with that holier than thou attitude of yours.</p>
<p>If at this point you are wondering what the fuck is this guy going on about - WELCOME TO TODFOD. This is what I do here. I ramble. And maybe the ramblings enter shitposting territory or maybe I just happen to be &ldquo;spitting the truth&rdquo; as the saying goes. I don&rsquo;t know. I never know. Half of what comes from my mouth may be nothing but incoherent babblings but half of them are pure unadulterated wisdom bits. So it always helps you to read everything I post. TODFOD it is. Break and shatter.</p>
<p>Also, I found a blog. Most of it is based on the idea of critiquing democracy and stuff. Writing &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; at the end of the sentence makes you look like an idiot doesn&rsquo;t it? Anyways, Didn&rsquo;t get around to reading all of it because the guy literally has a 300 page blog. Mencius makes sense and sometimes overdoses you in &lsquo;redpills&rsquo;. The blog is called <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/">UNQUALIFIED RESERVATIONS</a>. What do you think of it?</p>
<p>And, I have toned down on &ldquo;information in the new age&rdquo; as they call it which is I have turned down the news. It&rsquo;s all a shitshow ladies and gentlemen. It&rsquo;s all a shitshow. That&rsquo;s some serious wisdom right there.</p>
<p>This blog is dedicated to all the great friends. Now go to sleep.</p>
