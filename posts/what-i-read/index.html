    <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>These are all the books I have ever read and what I think about them. The authors or books are in no particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Kafka, Franz:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Trial : Read it when I was younger. Didn&rsquo;t get the whole point across then but it slowly crept on. Intriguing writing. Fantastic scenes.</li>
<li>Metamorphosis : A short read that is just perfect. I still go through pages of this book from time to time. One of the greatest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>J. R. R. Tolkien:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Hobbit : A mesmerizing tale, nothing falls short. Wildly beautiful characters. Always recommended.</li>
<li>The Lord Of The Rings : Expands on the hobbit and does not cut any corners. One of the most beautiful tales possibly ever told.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gabriel Garcia Marquez:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One Hundred Years Of Solitude: One of the boldest and most timeless stories I have ever read. I would like to have been in Macondo at the time. Not many books have made me feel such  a way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Huxley, Aldous:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Brave New World : Found it greately overrated. Didn&rsquo;t  like anything about it. Even the dystopian parts felt lazy. Island is a better work.</li>
<li>Island : Builds up great. Comes to a Huxley like closing. Like it better than BNW. It&rsquo;s alright.</li>
<li>Doors of Perception : A fascinating account. Nonetheless, I recommended taking psilocybin instead of reading about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wagle, Narayan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Palpasa Cafe : Overrated gargoyle. Reads like a real shitty Nepali movie. That&rsquo;s not saying much.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thapa, Manjushree:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forget Kathmandu : I want to forget that I read this book. Gives absolutely nothing, takes a few hours away. A cheap account of an Author&rsquo;s trek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sherchan, Bhupi:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ghumne Mech Mathi Andho Manche : Must be one of the only real poets of this dammned nation. Of the few Nepali things that have moved me, this is one of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Brown, Dan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Da vinci Code : Read it a long long time ago. Found it amusing then, find it amusing now.</li>
<li>The Lost Symbol : Kek. Don&rsquo;t remember much about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The White Company : It&rsquo;s nice and alright. Read it a long long time ago.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dostoevsky, Fyodor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Crime and Punishment : Drags on and off. Gets very intense and introspective at parts. A rewarding read.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vonnegut, Kurt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slaughterhouse Five : A good one. Intriguing. Humorous.</li>
<li>Cat&rsquo;s cradle : Liked this one. But have forgotten much about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ludwig J. Stiller:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nepal: Growth of a Nation : I recommend this. I can&rsquo;t compare it to much since I haven&rsquo;t read much history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sudheer Sharma:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prayogshala : I always wondered what this book was supposed to be. A supplement of modern Nepali history? Secrets in bureaucracy? Didn&rsquo;t even get around to finishing it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Salinger, J. D:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Catcher in the rye : A book worth remembering. I wanted to relate to the guy but all I could do was sympathize with him.</li>
<li>A Perfect Day for Bananafish :  Search it and read this story. Nabokov highly recommended this one and I do too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plato:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Alcibiades-I : Reading any philosophy is a mindfuck for the first time. I get this one. Other dialogues I am slowly getting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Orwell, George:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Farm : If you want to start reading. Start here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hemingway, Ernest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Old man and the Sea : One of the greatest stories I have ever read. Possibly my favorite story of all time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>I plan on reading more this year. Will update this list as time goes on. Got the idea from <a href="http://wmjas.wikidot.com/nabokov-s-recommendations">here</a></strong></em>.</p>
