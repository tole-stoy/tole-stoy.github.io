        <p>It has been hard. Hard to deal with. Hard to rest. Those summers we spent. Those winters we were. Just two songs in the same key. Two rocks in the same river. Flowing. Singing. I would hold you. You would hold me. We would be one and then you had to leave but were still one. Late nights we used to bother ourselves mercilessly. Too afraid to close the book for the night you would do as I did, say as I said, evergoing, sometimes to new places, sometimes to old. We would sleep and next day find ourselves in the same river as two stones, as two songs. Bumping each other. Smoothing each other out. I wish I could write you like I know you. I wish I could draw you as you are. My mere weak hands couldn&rsquo;t place you in words, or in lines. You were one impossible but you were mine. And I was yours. Under the hill of one &lsquo;damned&rsquo; place we first went. How true it got there. And now time has crept to us and we have shed tears. As if under some unknown mutiny by other halves of us we were predisposed to be here, as if an oracle was set to be and is. I find myself broke and I know you do too. I wish it was better. I wish it was. Remember the promises that we have kept one another. Remember the memories we gave one another. I do. I treasure them more than the deepest treasures. I will miss them more than anything. I will miss you more than anything.</p>
<p>Thank you love. You be all right now.</p>
