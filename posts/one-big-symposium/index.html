    <h1>One Big Symposium</h1>

        <p>All of reality must be probably programmed. But the feeling that all of this is a symposium
rather than a simulation is more fitting. Who is the conductor? Is he the one good gracious
high above? Or the one terrible down below? Who has understood what is means to understand?
Not you or me obviously.</p>
<p>What does the age of the phone, the internet, trump, climate change, quantitative easing tell us
about this world? That it is most surely out of our hands? Who has the keys? The selected elite or
are we all elites? Maybe we just forgot where the keys are?</p>
<p>Remember next time you scroll through your dumb feed how programmed it all is. The food you eat,
the content you consume, the movies you watch. All are mere data entry points for whatever the fuck
algorithm google or netflix is cooking up in its bunkers. Remember the food you eat. All pesticided up,
made to fit the calorie consumption and criteria some bureaucrat decided on because the cash dump
from pepsi was more than coke. Think about your life without the entire global economy and systems
backing it. Would you stand a chance on your own?</p>
<p>I know I wouldn&rsquo;t. I wouldn&rsquo;t stand a chance. But I have decided to take charge on these matters.
The question is will you? I am willing to take help and lend a hand. If you don&rsquo;t want to then Fuck Off.</p>
