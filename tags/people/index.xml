      <description>A tanking business. A ruined economy. Idiots and stupid IYI&amp;rsquo;s everywhere. A 50 km railway line. An unelected idiot in a elected place of business. A fragile heart. Virtue-signalling. Bigoteering. A college that will probably suck. A leaking roof for no reason. No money. Lots of money but nothing to do. Heat. Rain. Heat. Rain. A lockdown. A pandemic. Huge international organizations without much in terms of credibility or actual expertise.</description>

      <description>In this land of all forsaken souls one finds himself trapped by the making of his own fate, the cultivation of his own values. Even after resolutely defining parameters and a stringent moral self-structure there is nothing more devastating to be destroyed completely not by better ideals to improve upon but a rotten core that hardly has ever achieved anything or created anything. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Look around you. The asthetics you see, the corrupt nature of the soul that has shattered the pure beauty of all individual soul.</description>
