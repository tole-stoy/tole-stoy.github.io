      <description>Time is the only tool and actual vessel you have for wealth building. Time functions as the line and various points across that line you find your goals and systems. Systems are always built around or in time. Knowledge expands with time. Experience nurtures with time. Wasting it is one big folly. Learning to respect it is one big virtue.
All time until yesterday is lost. What I know now comes from not throughout the twenty years that I I have been here but from fragments.</description>
