      <description>From the time I spent managing a Business that dealt with wholesale I saw what happens when cashflow sucks. And what happens is that you will slowly but surely go out of business.
If you have a business that relies on heavy credit from the consumer and the downpayment or payment constitues only a small part of the sales then that means the cashflow is fucked because you have less cash.</description>
