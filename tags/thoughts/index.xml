      <description>What is not real? What is real? How much of the surface of this myopian crackle is configurable? What can I believe on? What makes up faith? How trustworthy is the internet?

Does pain need to be hidden?
Is it future?</description>

      <description>With all this death, hunger, killings in the name of nothing, dishonorable wars and people being blithering idiots in general nothing makes much sense anymore. You know Quasimodo predicted all of this. That guy huh.
