      <description>As I write these words there is a faint nicotine buzz in my head. Tobbacco can be fun but to be addicted to it would be quite a distaste for the body. But in moderation everything is alright. In moderation.
As I write this post I am in a vast expanse of tea plants and trees. The air is fresh. It smells of tea. There is a big beautiful tree across this small gentle stream and it is quite amazing.</description>
