      <description>In a couple of weeks todfod will be an year old. It has been a simple, quarantined year so far. I have told you some about my life updates.
At first todfod was thought of as a vessel for updating on life and other pursuits. It has done so wonderfully albeit things have been a bit vague. The theme has been switched up to add categories, SSL isn&amp;rsquo;t supported and there are images.</description>

      <description>Once life starts its course of all available alternate timelines and possibilities and goes from one to the other like leper frogs swimming in the monsoon rains of Asar, nothing can be calculated. Nor anything be put into order as one wishes. There are too many ways to choose from. Too many avenues to take. All the while one could be better than the other. While the one you took could be the worst.</description>

      <description>If any one is reading this blog right now and are constantly checking on new updates and feel disappointed, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry but I have nothing of value to say on a regular basis. I derive value on what I find valuable and don&amp;rsquo;t find my words worthy of paper at this moment. I have been going through life as a test of one&amp;rsquo;s ability in action and I think I am actually getting good at it with an equal realization of my stupidity and inability.</description>
