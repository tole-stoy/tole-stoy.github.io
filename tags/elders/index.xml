      <description>One day while playing around in one of my previous schools before St. Xaviers, I hit my head in one of the lower edges of a slide and had to get a few stiches. I just happened to remember that moment today. These remembrances of things past haven&amp;rsquo;t been a rare occuring these past few months. . It is as if the place I came back to had a few tapes to show me of me and now that I remember these moments, the heart fills up with a shuddering uneasiness and a hint of vague nostalgia.</description>
